# Input

Text inputs enable the user to input and interact with content and data. This component can be used for short form entries. For long form entries, please use the text area component. There are instances, sometimes in the same form, where you need users to enter both short and long form content. Allow the size of the text input box to reflect the length of the content you expect the user to enter.
