# Chip

Large chips are used to label an item as part of a larger whole, but can also include an icon that represents an associated action. These labels can be selected list options, or tags.

<z-chip text="one" class="mr-2" title="the first one" />
<z-chip text="two" class="bg-orange mr-2" />
<z-chip text="three" class="bg-green" />

``` html
<z-chip text="one" title="the first one" />
<z-chip text="two" class="bg-orange" />
<z-chip text="three" class="bg-green" />
```
